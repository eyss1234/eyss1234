  Full Stack Developer focused on building reliable, maintainable, and user-centred software.

  I work across the stack to design and implement pragmatic solutions to complex problems, with an emphasis on clarity, quality, and long-term maintainability.
</p>

<p align="center">
  With a background that blends technical and design thinking, I bring a structured, thoughtful approach to both product development and engineering decisions.

  I value continuous improvement, clear communication, and writing code that is easy to understand, test, and evolve.
